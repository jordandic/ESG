# ESG
This project aims to determine whether Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators from the EPA are significant factors in predicting return.
Data was downloaded from the Environmental Protection Agency's website and includes multiple data points related to various industries' overall impact on the environment. 
The dependent variable in this project was annual returns from various ETFs that were hand-picked to represent the overall financial performance of their corresponding industries. This edited, regressable data can be found in the "FinalData.csv" file.
As this project was done for a class at UTD called BUAN 6356, the R-file containing the analysis is called "BUAN 6356 final project analysis.R"
For an in-depth analysis of the data, refer to the .docx file. It includes models and interpretation of the various methods employed to analyze this data for singificant relationships.

Methods employed involve both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. Specifically, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, multi-variate linear regressions, and more. 
Overall, no significant relationship was found between selected emissions data from the EPA and returns of the hand-picked ETFs. 
This lack of significance supports the premise that there is no effective tax plan which aligns both environmental stewardship and financial incentives.
However, there were a couple industries which seemed to have some financial repurcussions from high costs associated with disposal of toxic waste.
